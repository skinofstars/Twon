Multi device light cycle game. 

## The Game

Err, you've seen Tron right? The game is simple and here it's still in development :)

### Done-ish

* There is a game arena with extendable boundaries. You can use several screens, both as the arena and for player controls.
* You control a lightcycle which only goes forwards and only turns at right angles.
* You lightcycle leaves a trail/line behind it, marking where it has been.
* You cannot cross either your own line or another players.
* If you hit your own line or the arena boundary, you've killed yourself.
* If you hit another player's line, they have killed you.
* Touch devices as controllers.

### TODO

* Title screen
* Scoring
* Vector based drawing
* More efficient collision

### Nice to have

* Riding near a boundary or another players line gives you a temporary speed boost.
* Brakes.
