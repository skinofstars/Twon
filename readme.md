Multi device light cycle game. 

The Game
--------

Err, you've seen Tron right? Well the game is simple (and still in development - so some features might be missing)

There is a game arena with clear boundaries. 
You control a lightcycle which only goes forwards and only turns at right angles.
You lightcycle leaves a trail/line behind it, marking where it has been.
You cannot cross either your own line or another players.
If you hit your own line or the arena boundary, you've killed yourself.
If you hit another player's line, they have killed you.
Riding near a boundary or another players line gives you a temporary speed boost.
You have brakes.

Tech
----

The idea behind this is to use several screens, both as the arena and for player controls.

We'd like to use touch devices as controllers. Needs left, right, brake and maybe a speed indicator.

Running
-------

requires node and npm

install dependencies:

    npm install

run the app:

    node app.js
